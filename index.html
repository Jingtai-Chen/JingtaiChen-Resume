        <p class="lead mb-4">Jared Diamond should have well explained why people recognize or deny innovations if he took practicality into account. In real life, People will be fond of new technology that gives them a good experience; Kevin kelly, who initially held a solid objection toward new technology, has a profound feeling about this idea. When he came into contact with the Internet for work reasons and gradually found that people who are active in the online world can cooperate better and generate more creativity, he began to accept the existence of innovations and immerse in them.Confucianism is mostly about getting educated to be a good person morally so you wouldn‚Äôt harm your society. Confucianism uses many virtue standards to determine whether you are a good person. The advantage of Confucian is making more and more people get educated and learn about being a good person so that everyone would consciously obey the rule and society would be free from disturbance. However, not everyone wants to learn or can get to learn. Even though confusion advocates made no distinction in learning, at that time, many people were still isolated from higher education, which means there were still many people who couldn‚Äôt become good people themselves.<br><br>

        In this case, we can not ensure no one would break the peace ‚Äì that means we need some rules or punishment to keep the order of society ‚Äì and that‚Äôs the advantage of legalism. Legalism advocate that a ruler needs strict rules to control people. We can use the law to restrict people from misbehavingKevin kelly has no chance to live in days when technology is lower in price and better in social cachet than right now; for sure, at that time, people hadn't gotten used to it. Nonetheless, Kevin Kelly tried and explored the good of technology by himself, which convinced him to let innovations infiltrate his life. Jared Diamond's three factors theoretically show why people love or do not love an innovation, but true love is only found if you practically test it out. 
<br><br>

        	 In ‚ÄúAccepting or Rejecting Innovation,‚Äù Jared Diamond argues that for people to acknowledge the necessary adoption of new technology, there are three factors that should be considered: worthiness in money, preference of the society nowadays, and ingrained personal interest or legal rights. In Jared Diamond‚Äôs opinion, an innovation wouldn‚Äôt apply to a large scale of population because people can‚Äôt make any profit; other than that, whether the trend of the population would appreciate it or not and how great it can coordinate with the entrenched system in our society, also crucial to its success stand. These three factors work together to examine how possible an innovation may perform in our society. I partially agree with Jared Diamond because the three factors he points out are essential for a new product to be accepted by people. However, his ideas are not comprehensive as it is missing the factor of how an innovation's practicality would affect whether people will adopt it.
